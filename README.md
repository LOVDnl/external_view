# External LOVD data viewer
This is the `External LOVD data viewer`. This package allows any PHP website to
 show live data from a remote LOVD3 instance.
The data views are fully functional, allowing searching and sorting.
The data views are defined in the settings file, after which they can be called with different search terms.
